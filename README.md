## Part 0: Problem Statement

Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>), (a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>), ..., (a<sub>n</sub>, b<sub>n</sub>) which makes the sum of min(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

### Example

Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4.

### Notes

n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].




## Part 1: Implement and Test

The first job is to implement a working solution that passes the given test. To do so, modify the code in `src/arrayPartition1.py`.

Testing is done by calling `runTests.py` from your command line.

If you've implemented a correct solution, the output should look like this:

```bash
$ ./runTests.py
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK```
